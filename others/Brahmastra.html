<Platform Configuration:>
	init.zip:
	    config.yml --> Done 
	    Machine Agent.py
	    Helper.py (TBD)(In case SSH doesn't work,used to run docker file)
	    Unused_Machine_IP.txt
	    /scheduler
	    /service LC
	    /Server LC
	    ....


<BootStrap Program:>
	1. Build Environment on the Machine (Install Docker /Python/ etc)
	2. SSH Machine using IP/Port available in config
	3. Send Platform Code to the Machine
	4. Run Machine Agent File / Helper.py
	5. Run all the services assgined to that machine


<Server Life Cycle Manager:>
	Who will send Request:
		1. Service Life Cycle Manager
	What Request:
		1. Allocate a Machine to run a service (either Available or New)
	Input Format:
		--> Count of Service to Run
	Steps to serve Request:
		1. Reads CPU stats available in RunTime Registry
		2. If among the available machines , if any is able to run a service then send IP/Port/other details of that Machine
		3. If No machine avilable, then SSH on Unuser_Machine_IP --> Copy Code on that Machine --->Run Machine.PY and Helper.py ---> Return IP/Port/other details to ServiceLCM
	Output Format:
		--> <IP/PORT/other> dictonary



<Service Life Cycle Manager:>
	Who will send Request:
		1. Request Manager
		2. Scheduler
		3. Topology Manager

	What Request:
		1. To Start/Stop User Services --> send via Request M / Scheduler
		2. To Start/Stop Platform Service --> send via Topology Manager
		3. reg

	Input Format:
		1. <UserID /Service Name /Service Env /Service other details(sensor)>
		2. <Platform Service ID,Machine IPport,status> (inbuilt will store path of each platform service)
	Steps to Server:
		
		Platform Service:
			1. In case any platform service gets down, topology manager will request service life cycle to start it again
			2. Using request status Service LCM will know whether Machine is Down or Program is Down[-----]
			3. If Machine is Down --> Request Server LCM for a Machine, SSH Machine, Run Program, Update details in Registry
			4. If Program is Down --> SSH machine and run the program again//
		
		User Service:
			1. Request Manager or Scheduler will send request to run user service
			2. Check service status from registry --> already running/stopped/Never Runned (Not Sure)----
			3. Get a Machine IP/Port from Server LCM
			4. Send Deoplyment Manager to Wrap the service with essential things and start the service on given Machine ID
			5. Store essential details of Service in Registry

	Output Format:
		1. Acknowledegement to requester that service runned successfully
		2. Or Error


<Request Manager:>
	Who Will Send Request:
		1. User
	What Request:
		1. Login/Logout
		2. To Upload/Download Zip file
		3. Sensor Registration
		4. Service Start/Stop
		5. Schedule Service
		6. Display Service Running Status
		Decide UI for this Module
	Input Formt:
		Web Based Portal
		On Click Input will be served
	Steps:
		1. For Login/Logout , Ask Authentication and serve the same
		2. For Upload and Download ---> Upload service will directly store extracted zip file in NFS(Repository)
		3. For Sensor Registration ---> Send the Config file to Sensor Registration and display the ACK send via SR
		4. Start / Stop Service Request --> Send request to Service LCM <FORMAT TBD>
		5. Schedule a Service ---> Based on UI / Config user will request for scheduling ---> Request will be passed to Sceduler Manager <FORMAT TBD>
		6. Display Running Status of Service ---> Start Time , CPU RAM,Memorty consumed by Program, Output if any


<Deployment Manager:>
	Who will send Request:
		1. Service LCM
	What Request:
		1. To start a User service on given Machine
	Input Format:
		<ServiceId,Path to ServiceRootDir,config file>
	Steps:
		1. Using UserID and Service ID, download Service Code from Repository
		2. Request Sensor Life Cycle Manager for Topic Name
		3. Parse the service config file and create docker file respectively
		3. Create Docker File for service and Pass Topic as Argument
		4. Send Docker File to Machine for Running
	Output:
		1. ACK to Service LCM


<Scheduler Manager:>
